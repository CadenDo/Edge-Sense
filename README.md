Edge Sense is a computer vision program centered around edge detection using a laptop's webcam. It was developed as my final project for Computer Methods 1 at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Written in C++ with OpenFrameworks in Visual Studio, it relies heavily on the OpenCV library. The program uses Canny edge detection to highlight edges and maps the results onto a grayscale image to compare what the camera sees versus what the program interprets, among other displayed transformations. 

Edge detection is the basis for many advanced algorithms that we see and may use daily. For example, gesture recognition systems use it as a base to translate American Sign Language into words for easier communication. Similarly, an object detection model—like those used in autonomous vehicles—applies this data to navigate roadblocks safely in addition to other sensors. I also implemented Hough’s line transformation to detect Canny's dominant lines, which can help with lane detection or verifying successful lane changes when integrated with other subsystems.
